  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      PathPioneer was born from a simple observation: traditional job boards and recruitment processes 
      fail to capture the dynamic nature of knowledge acquisition and skill development in today's rapidly 
      evolving job market.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision a world where your journey matters as much as your destinationâ€”where the paths you take 
      to develop skills become valuable assets themselves, and where those who pioneer effective learning 
      paths receive proper recognition and rewards.

    <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional job marketplaces suffer from fundamental limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skills are claimed but rarely demonstrated</li>
      <li>Job descriptions are static and keyword-driven</li>
      <li>The knowledge path to desired careers is unclear</li>
      <li>Mentors and guides receive no recognition for their contributions</li>
      <li>Learning and job-seeking are treated as separate activities</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      PathPioneer is building a decentralized platform that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates a protocol for recording and sharing knowledge paths</li>
      <li>Properly attributes path creation to pioneers</li>
      <li>Works with any AI system while maintaining shared path knowledge</li>
      <li>Builds verifiable credentials through journey completion</li>
      <li>Connects demonstrated abilities directly to opportunities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      PathPioneer is currently in early development. We're building our prototype and
      seeking partners, collaborators, and early adopters interested in reimagining how
      jobs and skills connect in the AI era.
