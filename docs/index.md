    <h2>Changing How We Connect Skills to Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      TalentWeaver is a revolutionary platform that transforms how people discover jobs and develop skills. 
      Instead of static job listings, we create dynamic AI-guided knowledge paths that connect job seekers 
      with opportunities through demonstrated abilities, while properly recognizing the creators who weave 
      valuable talent paths.
